## Why This Matters

In 2018, the frenzy over cryptocurrency reached an all-time high. While everyone seemed to be talking about the hottest investment of the year, the actual number of people with the confidence to invest was quite small. As one of Canada's largest players in the digital currency space with more than 100,000 customers on its trading platform, Coinsquare saw an opportunity to launch itself to a broader audience of potential investors.

With a product that's difficult to understand and an industry filled with horror stories and scams, people don’t know who to trust in the crypto category. In order to overcome negative perceptions and establish Coinsquare as the authoritative industry leader, they mirrored the truths of the category and built the brand's credibility through a connection strategy and media plan that took unexpected cues from Canada's most trusted financial institutions. Coinsquare's integrated launch campaign appeared not only in digital channels, but also during must-see TV (NBA and NHL playoffs), in high profile out-of-home locations, and in established business print media.
